# Week 4 - Section 7 8 9

## Calculating SS TOT - SS RES

SS TOT = Total Sum of Squares

SS RES = Sum of Squares of Residuals

After calculating SS and SR we go back to calculate the Coefficient of Determinations.

## Helper Function

The job of the helper function is to return a normalized or standardized data sets.

## Multi Variate Equation Update

We will now be taking displacement and weight into consideration. The initial equation only used horsepower. The equate will go from univariate (one variable/feature) to multivariate linear regression.

2x is not a multiple for the value. As shown in the image below. The 2 signify the second iteration (or result) for the feature. For example:

```bash
# alternate notation
       (2) = second iteration
x2 = x
        1 = feature
```

Even though the cart shows 1x 2x 3x they are just one iteration of data and not multiplications in the chart below.
