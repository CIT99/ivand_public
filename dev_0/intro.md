# MMA Predictor

The goal of my project 0 is to build a MMA fight predictor winner. For now primarily using the past performance and wins. Using a combo of data past wins, how they won, age, weight and other factors. I might change the project overall. It might be also interesting to take into consideration including the ref and where the fight took place. I would also like to see data of orthodox fighters vs south paws.
